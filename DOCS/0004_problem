I did sucessfully research up to level two of the overview pdf on my own.
However even if had come up with level three of their research notes I would
not have choosen to use them. Something about the statement:

	"P must be at least 6 digits long since the palindrome 111111 = 143Ã—777"

doesn't rub with me. It seems that there is an essential step missing, or some
assumption that might be difficult to spell out in the general case.

For this reason I also attempted to publish my findings to the mages at Project Euler,
I felt as I had achieved the some of the highest marks at least on this problem.
There is however a further optimization that would be easy to add, that would make the
concoction of this spell at least in the Albedo class range. But perhaps I am
getting ahead of myself.

Either way I need to remind myself to add that further optimization and attempt
a purification cleanse.
