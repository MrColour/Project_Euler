If problems dealing with the primality of numbers continue to appear I should
consider making something more suitable for dealing with numbers that have
this attribute.

Need for further research is inconclusive.

The overview pdf, makes use of sqrt(3). I would be ever so careful dancing
with floating point numbers. Unless proven with absolute need they should
not be carelessly used by the laymans magicians. Not that writers of the overview pdf
are your average magician, but rather that for my own safety I'll choose not to use
that method for now.

On that note, praise to the IEEE wizards for creating standards to safely
contain this dangerous magic. Although I have acquired substainal certifiction
on this magic, going so far as becoming proficient in the extraction of the
sign, exponent and mantissa to the creation of infinite circles of ascii digits
with these bits in both the art of double precision and x86 extended precision,
I am still wary of the use of this powerful witchcraft. I would urge any magician
in the study of the IEEE research notes before making claims about the magical
constructs we take for granted.
