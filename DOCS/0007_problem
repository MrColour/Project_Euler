I should start making some of my spells into sub spells so that I may use them
in the future. Although I have been trying to make them general enough such
that most of the spells took an input it is probably wiser to make them into
subspells.

I have unfortunately stumbled across a bit of a problem. You see some of the
spells encountered here are used in the premagistrites preliminaries. Although
I have not yet been caught publishing my work, it would eventually be known.

After some serious thought about how I should approach the publication of
my work I have decided for now to continue. The point of Project Euler was
for the quality problems it provided and as a means for me to stretch
my limbs as I continue my career in magecraft. This business of ranks
was never my goal. If anyone claims to be a proficient magecraft, then
when the going gets tough they will prove it themselves. If you let them
decieve you, well then that is on you. The Heart of the Code will show itself
to the true mages amoung us.


Further Research Needed:
	Needs to study on prime spells and create a small factory for them.
	A math library might help but then I might become too dependent on it
	and counter intuitive to the purpose of some of this research.

	An Eratosthenes sieve as big as MAX_INT if possible. Also saving these
	numbers in a file would be useful so I can parse them out and create
	an on demand prime table. Not sure of the practicallity of it however.
