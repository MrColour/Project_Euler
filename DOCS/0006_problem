One simple mistake in the measurement threw everything off balance!
I should practice my precision and accuracy on these things and avoid
making simple math mistakes.

On that note, the arcane workbench developed by Desmos has proven quite
useful. It gives me a method by which to cross verify that my
steps are both sound and written correctly. Perhaps I should use it
more often, but nothing quite beats the good old classic quill and scroll
for making magical artifacts.

Although the spell I created is a A rank (perhaps even an A+) spell, I
didn't simplify the terms at the end. I was too lazy at the end of the day
and wanted to get it done after the frustration it gave me. I should note that
even the overview pdf didn't simplify the terms (PS this was hinted by a user
so I need to conduct a follow up to ensure this information is actually true).

To add to my studies is a research factory platform to better formalize my
findings. LaTeX is the the obvious choice of language, but it is rather finicky
about the scroll quality, and I would need to get a converter to see the end
product.

Further Research Needed:
	I should make some automata spells for dealing with binomial equations.
	Also would need to publish some research papers on the subject of binomials,
	Pascals Triangle, and the summation of polynomials.

	This might be the second or the third time I have proven and reresearch these
	concepts.
